## My process

### 🛠️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### 💡 What I learned

**Fetch** in JavaScript is a modern API for making HTTP requests (such as getting data from a server) asynchronously, using a promise-based approach to handle responses in a cleaner and more powerful way, allowing you to retrieve resources (JSON, images, files) and manipulate requests/responses easily with global fetch() functions and Request/Response objects.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
fetch('/data.json').then((response) => {  
  if(!response.ok) return console.log('Oops! Something went wrong.');
  
  return response.json();
}).then((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```
